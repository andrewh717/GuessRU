# GuessRU
Project for HackRU Fall 2018
## Inspiration
All of the days in high school where we would sit in the library playing GeoGuessr instead of doing work.
## What it does
GuessRU essentially is GeoGuessr, except limited to the Rutgers New Brunswick campus. Users will hit buttons to guess which campus they are on based on the Streetview.
## How we built it
We used React, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS to build our project.
## Challenges we ran into
Occasionally, no Streetview image would be shown. So, we implemented an error checker that refreshes the page until a proper image is shown.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
It works (and on mobile)!
## What we learned
Never give, never surrender. Improvise. Adapt. Overcome. Sometimes your original idea is too lofty and you have to ground it in reality. 
## What's next for GuessRU
Scoring features, such as correct guessing streaks and highest score.
